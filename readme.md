# ResumeCraft üéØ

*Intelligently optimize LaTeX resumes with AI-powered keyword integration*

## Description

ResumeCraft automates LaTeX resume customization using Azure OpenAI to strategically incorporate job-relevant keywords while maintaining formatting and structure. 

> **For Recruiters:** Yes, this is technically "gaming the system" - but building an AI-powered LaTeX automation tool that preserves document structure, handles modular files, integrates with cloud APIs, and maintains semantic meaning probably tells you more about my engineering skills than any keyword-stuffed bullet point ever could. üòâ

## Features

- **Smart Keyword Integration**: Maps keywords to relevant resume sections (ML ‚Üí ML projects, Web Dev ‚Üí Web projects)
- **Modular LaTeX Support**: Handles both single-file and `\subfile`-based resume structures
- **Job Description Parsing**: Automatically extracts keywords from job descriptions using LLM
- **Format Preservation**: Maintains exact LaTeX formatting, spacing, and one-page constraint
- **PDF Generation**: Compiles optimized resumes directly to PDF
- **Original File Safety**: Never modifies source files - creates timestamped output folders

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/resumecraft.git
cd resumecraft
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Configure Azure OpenAI**
```bash
export AZURE_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

Update `AZURE_DEPLOYMENT` and `AZURE_ENDPOINT` in `resume_optimizer.py`.

4. **Install LaTeX** (for PDF compilation)
- **Windows**: MiKTeX
- **macOS**: MacTeX  
- **Linux**: `sudo apt-get install texlive-full`

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
# With keywords file
python resume_optimizer.py resume.tex keywords.txt

# With job description (auto-extracts keywords)
python resume_optimizer.py resume.tex job_description.txt --jd

# Keep LaTeX files for inspection
python resume_optimizer.py resume.tex keywords.txt --keep-tex
```

### File Structure
```
resumecraft/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ resume_optimizer.py      # Main script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ resume.tex              # Your original resume
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ subsections/            # Subfile components (if modular)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ education.tex
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ experience.tex
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ skills.tex
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ keywords.txt            # Keywords or job description
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ optimized_resume_*/     # Generated output folders
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ resume_optimized.pdf
```

### Input Files

**keywords.txt** (comma-separated):
```
React, Node.js, Python, Machine Learning, TensorFlow, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS
```

**job_description.txt** (full job posting):
```
We're looking for a Full Stack Developer with experience in React, Node.js, 
and cloud platforms like AWS. Knowledge of Docker and CI/CD pipelines preferred...
```

## Command Line Options

```bash
python resume_optimizer.py [resume.tex] [input.txt] [options]

Options:
  --jd              Input file contains job description (extract keywords)
  -o, --output      Custom output path
  --keep-tex        Keep intermediate LaTeX files
  --no-pdf          Skip PDF compilation
```

## VS Code Integration

Run directly in VS Code terminal:
```bash
python resume_optimizer.py resume.tex keywords.txt
```

Or add to `.vscode/tasks.json`:
```json
{
    "label": "Optimize Resume",
    "type": "shell",
    "command": "python",
    "args": ["resume_optimizer.py", "resume.tex", "${input:keywordFile}"]
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Parse Structure**: Detects modular LaTeX files and combines content
2. **Extract Keywords**: Processes job descriptions or keyword lists
3. **AI Optimization**: Uses Azure OpenAI to strategically place keywords
4. **Smart Mapping**: Routes keywords to relevant sections based on content
5. **Preserve Format**: Maintains LaTeX structure and one-page constraint
6. **Generate Output**: Creates PDF in timestamped folder

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Azure OpenAI API access
- LaTeX distribution (TeX Live, MiKTeX, or MacTeX)
- Dependencies: `langchain-openai`, `langchain-core`

## Example Output

```
Reading resume: resume.tex
Found 5 subfiles
  - subsections/education.tex
  - subsections/experience.tex
  - subsections/skills.tex
Extracted keywords: React, Node.js, Python, AWS, Docker
Optimizing resume...
